            <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The first step to submit your proposal is to set up, or review for returning speakers, your speaker profile <a href="https://postgresopen.org/events/speakerprofile/pgopen2017/">here</a>.
              This system uses the PostgreSQL Community Auth system (the same system used by the PostgreSQL wiki, CommitFest, and pgconf.eu).  Log in
              to the system with your PostgreSQL Community Auth credentials.  Please note that while this is the same code, the speaker profiles are
              not shared between pgconf.eu and postgresopen.org.</li>

              <li>Once you've created your profile, this page will provide a link to a form where you can submit your
              talks for PostgresOpen 2017. When the site prompts for a login, use your
              regular postgresql.org community account.  Should you already have your speaker profile, you can go to
              the talk submission page directly <a href="https://postgresopen.org/events/callforpapers/pgopen2017/">here.</a>
